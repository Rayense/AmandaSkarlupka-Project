The data folder contains both the raw and processed data. The data was processed using the processing_script.rmd located within the processing code subfolder. 

The raw data folder contains the original excel spreadsheet that contains 6 different sheets. Two being antigen and antibody keys, and the other four being the HAI titers of P1, CA/09, monoclonal, and sera responses. 

The processed data contains the cleaned versions of the individual sheets. It also combined the antigen and antibody keys with the monoclonal HAI titers when needed.
