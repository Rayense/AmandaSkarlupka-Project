This Rmarkdown contains the supplemental data and figures for Amanda Skarlupka's Data Science Project.

Supplemental figures 1 and 2. Overall the CA/09 and SC/18 isolated monoclonal anitbodies elicit a broad reactivity against the swine viruses. None of the Brisbane/07 or PueroRico/1934 antibodies had any reactivity. 

```{r resultfigure1,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 1. The HA inhibition of swine viruses from co-incubation with wild-type raised murine monoclonal antibodies. The facets are grouped by swine virus.', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_WTmab_by_antigen.png"))
```


```{r resultfigure2,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 2. The HA inhibition of swine viruses from co-incubation with wild-type raised murine monoclonal antibodies. The facets are grouped by antibody.', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_WTmab_by_mab.png"))
```

Supplemental Figures 3 and 4. The CA/09 and P1 monoclonal antibody response grouped by antigen, respectively. The breadth of reactivity of the swine viruses are not of the main focus but it is still intersting to note that some viruses are more cross-reactive than others with the different monoclonals. 

```{r resultfigure3,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 3. The HA inhibition of swine viruses from co-incubation with CA/09 raised murine monoclonal antibodies. The facets are grouped by virus', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_ca09_mab_by_antigen.png"))
```

```{r resultfigure4,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 4. The HA inhibition of swine viruses from co-incubation with P1 raised murine monoclonal antibodies. The facets are grouped by virus', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_p1mab_by_antigen.png"))
```

```{r resultfigure5,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 5. The quantification of monoclonals that inhibit each virus', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_univariate_antigen.png"))
```


```{r resultfigure6,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 6. Principle component analysis of the HAI titers of polyclonal sera from individual mice with antibodies to CA/09 or P1. Mice are numbered 1-6 for CA/09 and 7-14 for P1. Two mice for P1 (Mouse ID 2 and 10) were removed from the analysis due to missing HAI titers against some of the swine viruses. The swine viruses are represented as vectors', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_sera_pca.png"))
```

The plot above is also known as variable correlation plots. It shows the relationships between all variables. It can be interpreted as follow:

Positively correlated variables are grouped together.
Negatively correlated variables are positioned on opposite sides of the plot origin (opposed quadrants).
The distance between variables and the origin measures the quality of the variables on the factor map. Variables that are away from the origin are well represented on the factor map.

```{r resultfigure7,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 7. Principle component analysis of the HAI titers of wild-type raised monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are color coded. The swine viruses are represented as vectors.', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_ca09_pca.png"))
```

```{r resultfigure8,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 8. Principle component analysis of the HAI titers of P1 raised monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are color coded. The swine viruses are represented as vectors.', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_p1_pca.png"))
```

```{r resulttable1,  fig.cap='Supplemental Table 1. The full logistic model results', echo= FALSE}
readRDS(here::here("results", "tables", "full_logistic_model.rds"))
```
```{r resultfigure9,  fig.cap='Supplemental Figure 9. All of the predictor variables for the different monoclonal antibody gropus. Clone_name, Elisa_specificity, and antigen were removed from the final analysis.', echo= FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("results", "figures", "supp_different_predictors.png"))
