# Overview

Amanda Skarlupka's data analysis for the MADA project/paper done with R/Rmarkdown/Github. 

# Pre-requisites

This is a template for a data analysis project using R, Rmarkdown (and variants, e.g. bookdown), Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex (I recommend [Jabref](http://www.jabref.org/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)). It is also assumed that you have a word processor installed (e.g. MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). You need that software stack to make use of this template.
